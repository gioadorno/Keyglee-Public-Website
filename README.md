# Keyglee Public Website
 
This project is going to be the Public Website or Domain, for AEM Real Estate/Keyglee Dispo.

My idea going in to creating this project is to elevate the quality of how website design and functionalities are generally created. As you will see I created the website to be modern and unique for the user experience. 

# Main Page

The main page consists of sections that flow together easily as the user/client scrolls through the website seamlessly. In one section you will see I have made an excellent way to showcase/display properties utilizing Google Map API/Places (I will explain more about this below) and also a way to scroll through properties including photos and the agent with contact info.

  - Utilizing the Google Map API for the first time was a fun challenge, as I have never utilized it before. I wanted to create essentially my own "Zillow" in how to easily display proporties, showcase it on the map, show property info, and the agent with whom to contact if interested for the property. Something simple, straight to the point, and stripped down from a lot of "noise" that may be on the screen. Also this is a great tool for the sales team to easily search a properties that the company itself has in its inventory and explain it to a potential seller/buyer. How the information is gathered to display this information is from an internal form called 'Property Forms' that is a single web page for the internal team to utilize to showcase what properties they want to display on the Main Page.
